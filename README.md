# AgriVision Doctor

Production-ready AI system with automated background removal and Grad-CAM visual diagnostics.

AgriVision Doctor is an enterprise-grade Streamlit application designed for rapid, field-level botanical diagnostics. Powered by a custom-trained ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network, the system can accurately identify 38 distinct plant pathogens and healthy states across 14 different crop species.

## Core Features

* Deep Learning Diagnostics: Utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model to classify images into 38 distinct categories with high confidence.
* Auto-Isolate Leaf (Alpha Matting): Integrates rembg with advanced alpha matting to automatically strip complex backgrounds, allowing the AI to focus purely on the botanical structure.
* AI Focus X-Ray (Grad-CAM): Generates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps in real-time, overlaying a visual representation of the exact cellular structures that triggered the AI's diagnosis.
* Actionable Protocols: Maps identified pathogens directly to an internal database of recommended agricultural treatments and mitigation strategies.
* Dual-Input Processing: Supports both local file uploads and live device-camera capture streams.
* Enterprise UI/UX: Features a responsive, dark-mode CSS dashboard optimized for both desktop analysis and mobile field-use.
